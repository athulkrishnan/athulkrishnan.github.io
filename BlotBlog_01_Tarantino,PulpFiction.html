<p>“<em>At BLOT, you know, we eat, pray and love films</em>”</p>

<p>“<em>Film? What’s a film</em>?”</p>

<p>“<em>Well, you know, the stuff they show in theatres</em>?”</p>

<p>“<em>I don’t frequent theatres</em>”</p>

<p>“<em>Yeah, but, you are aware that there’s an establishment called cinema theatres, and at this establishment they show films, right</em>?”</p>

<p>“<em>Yeah. So what?</em>”</p>

<p>“<em>Well, today we are going on a rant about one of our favourite direct’s most respected movies</em>”</p>

<p>“<em>What? Who?</em>”</p>

<p>“<em>Say what one more goddamn time, I dare you</em>”</p>

<p>It is widely accepted that a good film asks more questions than it answers. A good movie engages the audience, rather than giving them a comfortable, air-conditioned sit-through during a <strong>layover in limbo</strong>. Yeah, we know you were thinking about Nolan’s Inception (and we share the emotion) which was more like an advanced psychology course mixed with equally advanced courses in physics and philosophy.</p>

<p>But today, we want to talk about one of the finest works of one of the most revered auteurs of our time, Quentin Jerome Tarantino. Two decades after its release, Pulp Fiction, is still one of the best loved, and most quoted in cinema history - and quite possibly Tarantino’s finest work till date. And one of the most inquisitive of movies.</p>

<p>“<em>What do they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in France? What does Marcellus Wallace look like? What, for the love of Christ, was in the briefcase</em>?”</p>

<p>And living up to Tarantino’s distinct style, this movie is stacked up with meta, in-jokes, and paid a hell lot of tributes to other films. So, just in case you weren’t already aware - here are some facts about one of the goriest, shadiest, and sweatiest films ever made.</p>

<p>1) At the end of Pulp Fiction , Jules says he wants to become a “drifter.” In Kill Bill Volume 2, Samuel L. Jackson appears as a piano-playing drifter, called Rufus.</p>

<p>2) After the movie’s iconic dance scene, you see Vincent Vega and Mia Wallace walk into her house holding a trophy. The audience assumes they won the contest, but later in the film, a barely audible advert states the trophy had been stolen - meaning Vince and Mia lost the competition then stole the trophy.</p>

<p>3) The shot of Vincent plunging the syringe of adrenaline into Mia’s chest was filmed by having John Travolta pull the needle out, then reversing the footage.</p>

<p>4) A theme throughout the film is guns not being used as intended. A close-range gunshot miraculously misses Jules, Vincent accidentally shoots Marvin in the face, Butch shoots Vincent with a gun that was meant to kill him and, at the end of the film, it is Jules’ gun that preventsviolence in the coffee shop.</p>

<p>5) Jules’ famous and oft-quoted Bible passage was in fact made up by Quentin Tarantino and Samuel L. Jackson. Only the final two lines feature in Ezequiel 25:17.</p>

<p>6) The ‘Bad Mother F*cker’ wallet Jules has in the film actually belonged to Quentin Tarantino. The inscription is a reference to the theme song of Shaft, a role Samuel L. Jackson later went on to play.</p>

<p>7) The film’s title is self-referential. ‘Pulp’ magazines were popular during the mid–20th century and famed for their graphic violence and punchy dialogue - exploited to attract a readership. The film’s content mirrors these overt, unapologetic stylings.</p>

<p>8) The ‘F word’ is said 265 times during Pulp Fiction.</p>

<p>9) Pumpkin/Honey Bunny’s style of robbery - rounding up a mass of people and stealing their money - is a direct reference to The Great Train Robbery (1903).</p>

<p>10) The mystery of what’s in Marcellus Wallace’s briefcase has raged for years. Some argue it’s Elvis’ gold suit from True Romance, others the diamonds fromReservoir Dogs. The most popular theory is that it’s Marcellus Wallace’s soul, hence the case’s glow, the plaster on the back of Wallace’s head (this is where the soul is removed) and the combination - 666. In reality, the band aid on Wallace’s head was used to cover a shaving scar suffered by actor Ving Rhames, and though Quentin Tarantino’s original script had the briefcase containing diamonds, he quickly dismissed this as it was too similar to Reservoir Dogs. Instead, Tarantino thought it better to never reveal (or even decide) what was in the case, in the hope people would guess, speculate and create their own theories. It worked.</p>

<p>11) When Jules and Vincent shakedown the college kids for Marcellus’ briefcase, Jules helps himself to a bite of Brett (Frank Whaley)’s “tasty burger.” The fast food chain it’s from is Big Kahuna Burger, a fictional Hawaiian boiger joint Tarantino references throughout his movies.</p>

<p>In Reservoir Dogs , Mr. Blonde snacks on one after the robbery. The Gecko brothers in From Dusk Till Dawn (which Tarantino wrote) wolf them down after shooting up a liquor store. They also receive a mention in True Romance . AndDeath Proof . Oh, and Four Rooms .</p>
